Project Genome-wide transcript end mapping reveals novel processing events in plant organelles

Investigators: Leni Campbell-Clause, Ian Small, Catherine Colas des Francs-Small

This project contains
Julia scripts circus2.jl and circus3.jl for the mapping of specialised short-read RNAseq used to capture primary and processed transcript ends in Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts and mitochondria. 
Julia notebooks used to distinguish processed and primary transcripts based on the posterior mean from a Beta distribution, termed beta scoring.
