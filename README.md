# Genome-wide transcript end mapping reveals novel processing events in plant organelles

### Investigators: Leni Campbell-Clause, Ian Small, Catherine Colas des Francs-Small

### This repository contains
1. Julia scripts circus2.jl and circus3.jl for the mapping of specialised short-read RNAseq used to capture primary and processed transcript ends in Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts and mitochondria. 
2. Julia notebooks used to distinguish processed and primary transcripts based on the posterior mean from a Beta distribution, termed beta scoring.
